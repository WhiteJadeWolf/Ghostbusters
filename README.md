* To open the level editor, you can click on the Level Editor option in main menu. Alternatively, you can run level_editor.py in the main folder or run 'level_editor.exe' file.
* By default, level editor starts with level 4 so that accidental edits of existing levels are avoided.
* The blank space in sprite selector is the eraser -- so use it accordingly.
* If you want to load an existing level's map, use <- -> buttons on the bottom right to select the level and then press 'LOAD'.
* Saving existing levels with new level designs will replace the old one.
* To scroll along the map, use arrow keys.
* Once you are done with the level design, you can save it. To play the level, open main.py with any code editor and change 'level' parameter to the corresponding level where you saved it. Also, you can add it to the queue of existing levels by following the order of levels and changing 'MAX_LEVEL' parameter accordingly.
